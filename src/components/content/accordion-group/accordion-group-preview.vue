						The Flux Capacitor
					</template>

					<p>In the world of Back to the Future, the time circuits are the heart of the DeLorean's time-traveling capabilities. With a simple keypad interface, Doc Brown can input any date and time to travel to. The display shows the destination time, the present time, and the last departed time.</p>
					<p>It's a marvel of 1980s science fiction, giving Marty the ability to journey to the past, present, or future at the press of a button. The time circuits add an element of urgency and excitement, as every second counts when avoiding time paradoxes and ensuring the timeline remains intact.</p>

						The DeLorean
					</template>

					<p>The DeLorean, with its gull-wing doors and stainless steel body, is not just any car—it's a time machine! Doc Brown chose this iconic vehicle for its unique look and build. Once it hits 88 miles per hour, thanks to the flux capacitor and a little plutonium, it tears through the fabric of space-time, leaving flaming tire tracks in its wake. Whether it's speeding through the past or racing into the future, the DeLorean is the epitome of 80s sci-fi coolness.</p>
