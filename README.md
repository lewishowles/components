# Components

A library of beautiful components with a focus on accessibility, as well as ease of use for developers and for users.

## Why accessibility?

Accessibility is one of the most important things we can spend time improving. The web is for everyone, and making steps to ensure content is as accessible as possible helps everyone, not just those who need it most.

This library helps improve accessibility not just by implementing a set of standards into the components so that they're provided without effort from the developer, but the docs also help promote the mindset of accessibility, and some components even show visible errors if standards are not metâ€”such as form fields requiring labels.

## Setup

At the moment, components in the library are registered globally, so there is no need to manually import any of the components. To use the library, set it up in your main file, for example:

```javascript
import { createApp } from "vue";
import App from "./App.vue";
import components from "@lewishowles/components";

const app = createApp(App);

app.use(components);
app.mount("#app");
```

## Using a component

Since components are globally registered for now, you can simply use them directly anywhere in your app. For example:

```html
<ui-button @click="doMagic">
	ðŸª„ Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo
</ui-button>
```

You can find more information about each component on its relevant docs page.

## Scaffolding

Special scaffold scripts have been created to generate files for a new component (or icon). These can be found at `support/scaffold-component.sh` and `support/scaffold-icon.sh`.

## Roadmap

There are a number of improvements and new components that could be made to improve flexibility.

- Avatar list - shapes and sizes?
- Gauge Chart - to show a single piece of information in comparison to a range, allowing for odd-sizes regions, custom colours, and semi-circular or flat options
- Rating / Star component, with options to just display the rating or let the user change it. Emits an even when changing. Allows different display modes, such as stars, hearts, and whether to show all shapes or just one, and whether to show partial shapes or only full.
- Form select
- Form date - including three clearly labelled fields
- Checkbox group - A set of checkboxes with optional introductory text
- Notifications - an extension of summary-details, when provided a list of notifications letting the user view those notifications, showing an unread count, highlighting unread notifications, marking notifications as read, marking all notifications as read, dismissing notifications, and limiting the number of notifications (read) that appear.
- Stepper - to show step-by-step information or a multi-page form
- Devise a system to allow the definition of a "brand colour" and "dark brand colour" to override any defaults. Perhaps a stylesheet.
- Add notes about default recommended stylesheet.
